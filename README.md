# Ministry.WebDriver.Extensions #
This project is set up to provide a basic styled framework to build a page structured model for writing UI Automation tests against. The attached Google libraries act as samples to create a simple model to run tests against using the framework code in the main libraries. You can use these as a starting point.

## Initial Setup ##
You will need to ensure the following for all the tests in the Extensions to pass...

   1. Ensure you have IE, Firefox and Chrome installed.

   2. Ensure that 'Enable Protected Mode' is turned off in ALL zones in IE.
